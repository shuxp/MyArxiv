Recently, various methods and datasets have\nshowcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However, camera movement\nsynthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to\nthe scarcity of paired data. Thus, we present DCM, a new multi-modal 3D\ndataset, which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion\nand music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of\npaired dance-camera-music data from the anime community, covering 4 music\ngenres. With this dataset, we uncover that dance camera movement is\nmultifaceted and human-centric, and possesses multiple influencing factors,\nmaking dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or\ndance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties, we propose\nDanceCamera3D, a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel\nbody attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation, we\ndevise new metrics measuring camera movement quality, diversity, and dancer\nfidelity. Utilizing these metrics, we conduct extensive experiments on our DCM\ndataset, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence showcasing the\neffectiveness of our DanceCamera3D model.

However,\ntraditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,\nsuch as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle\nConsistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of\ncycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval\ninconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle\nsegments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization. These results confirm the efficacy of\nour approach in addressing irregular repetitions in videos and pave the way for\nfurther advancements in video analysis and understanding.\n","authors":["Hang Wang","Zhi-Qi Cheng","Youtian Du","Lei Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11959v2.pdf","comment":"Source code: https://github.com/hwang-cs-ime/IVAC-P2L"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13501v1","updated":"2024-03-20T10:58:58Z","published":"2024-03-20T10:58:58Z","title":"VSTAR: Generative Temporal Nursing for Longer Dynamic Video Synthesis","summary":"  Despite tremendous progress in the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis,\nopen-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with\ndynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static\nvideos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text\nprompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic\nvideo synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where\nwe aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve\ncontrol over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We\npropose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients:\n1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis\nbased on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate\ntextual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal\nAttention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the\ntemporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables\ncontrol over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of\nthe proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over\nexisting open-sourced T2V models.

Despite the remarkable performance\nof previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to\nthe well-annotated data. However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is\nexpensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the\nmultimodal scenario. In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from\nthe Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.\nTraining with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges --\nenforcing the multimodal samples to \\emph{align incorrect semantics} and\n\\emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To\ntackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based\non Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval. First, we propose a\nsemantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy\nlabels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend\ndifferent modalities and provide precise transport cost. Second, to narrow the\ndiscrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to\ninfer the semantic-level cross-modal matching. Both of these two components\nleverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate\neffective cost function.

The expanding variety of\nPre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for\nspecific tasks. Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is\nselecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely\non the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images.\nIn this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a\nVLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the \"Modality Gap\" -- the disparity in\nVLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable\nsubstitute for images; and the \"Capability Gap\" -- the discrepancy between the\nVLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct\nprediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general\nperformance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the\nnegative impact of these two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to\ncapture the relevance between open-source datasets and target dataset with a\ntransportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics\nof VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging those two\ngaps and enhancing the VLM's capacity estimation for VLM selection.

However, it often suffers inferior performance\ncompared to the feature knowledge distillation. In this paper, we argue that\nexisting logit-based methods may be sub-optimal since they only leverage the\nglobal logit output that couples multiple semantic knowledge. This may transfer\nambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end, we\npropose a simple but effective method, i.e., Scale Decoupled Distillation\n(SDD), for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output\ninto multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for\nthem. This helps the student to mine and inherit fine-grained and unambiguous\nlogit knowledge. Moreover, the decoupled knowledge can be further divided into\nconsistent and complementary logit knowledge that transfers the semantic\ninformation and sample ambiguity, respectively. By increasing the weight of\ncomplementary parts, SDD can guide the student to focus more on ambiguous\nsamples, improving its discrimination ability. Extensive experiments on several\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDD for wide\nteacher-student pairs, especially in the fine-grained classification task.

Despite its importance, research\nin POM skills remains limited, because learning manipulation skills requires\npose-varying simulation environments and datasets. This paper introduces\nManiPose, a pioneering benchmark designed to advance the study of pose-varying\nmanipulation tasks. ManiPose encompasses: 1) Simulation environments for POM\nfeature tasks ranging from 6D pose-specific pick-and-place of single objects to\ncluttered scenes, further including interactions with articulated objects. 2) A\ncomprehensive dataset featuring geometrically consistent and\nmanipulation-oriented 6D pose labels for 2936 real-world scanned rigid objects\nand 100 articulated objects across 59 categories. 3) A baseline for POM,\nleveraging the inferencing abilities of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to analyze the\nrelationship between 6D pose and task-specific requirements, offers enhanced\npose-aware grasp prediction and motion planning capabilities.

Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They\ndominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training\nMLPs compared to autoregressive networks.\n  In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion\nforecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a\nunified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.\nHowever, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units\n-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal\nand semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized\nattention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and\ndifferent position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding\nthe transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while\nadopting RoPE for temporal relativity.

However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a\nslight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under\nstandard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our\nresults also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within\ncontext-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm\nmake them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --\nthe first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for\nunderstanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad\nimpacts its reasoning power.\n","authors":["William Merrill","Ashish Sabharwal"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07923v4.pdf","comment":"9-page preprint.

This\ntaxonomy follows a three-tier structure, starting from broad methodology\ncategories and ending with specific techniques. It aids researchers in\ncomprehending the complex relationships between different algorithms and their\ntechniques. We employ a rigorous Observational and experimental evaluation to\nrank these varying techniques. For the Observational evaluation, we assess\ntechniques based on a set of four criteria. The experimental evaluation ranks\nthe algorithms employing the same techniques, sub-categories, and categories.\nAlso the paper illuminates the future prospects of ML classification techniques\nfor wafer defect identification, underscoring potential advancements and\nopportunities for further research in this field\n","authors":["Kamal Taha"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10705v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00477v2","updated":"2024-03-20T15:25:02Z","published":"2023-12-01T10:18:50Z","title":"Interpretable Meta-Learning of Physical Systems","summary":"  Machine learning methods can be a valuable aid in the scientific process, but\nthey need to face challenging settings where data come from inhomogeneous\nexperimental conditions.

Many\nworks have investigated the effect of widely adopted data augmentation and\nadversarial training techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the\nprivacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often\nmeasured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether\na particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to\ninvestigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the\nlens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading\nresults as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks\nas members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem,\nwe deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization\ndegrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil several\nfindings about the connections between three essential properties of machine\nlearning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial\nrobustness. We demonstrate that the generalization gap and privacy leakage are\nless correlated than those of the previous results.

The price to pay for including them in the\ncalculations, however, is a dramatic increase in the overall computational\ncosts. Recently, deep graph networks have been employed as efficient,\ndata-driven surrogate models for predicting properties of complex systems\nrepresented as graphs. These models rely on a local and iterative message\npassing strategy that should, in principle, capture long-range information\nwithout explicitly modeling the corresponding interactions. In practice, most\ndeep graph networks cannot really model long-range dependencies due to the\nintrinsic limitations of (synchronous) message passing, namely oversmoothing,\noversquashing, and underreaching.

It is a typical example that the model knows \"A's father is\nB\", but is unable to reason \"B's child is A\". This limitation poses a challenge\nto the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a\ngap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In\nthis paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root\ncause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the\ntraining and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language\nmodels to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly,\npermutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since\nthis can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous\npermutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing\nchallenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address\nthis issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which\naddresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units\n(i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting\nthese units before feeding into the model.

However, since the model\nis split at a specific layer, known as a cut layer, into both client-side and\nserver-side models for the SFL, the choice of the cut layer in SFL can have a\nsubstantial impact on the energy consumption of clients and their privacy, as\nit influences the training burden and the output of the client-side models. In\nthis article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the SFL process and\nthoroughly analyze energy consumption and privacy. This analysis considers the\ninfluence of various system parameters on the cut layer selection strategy.\nAdditionally, we provide an illustrative example of the cut layer selection,\naiming to minimize clients' risk of reconstructing the raw data at the server\nwhile sustaining energy consumption within the required energy budget, which\ninvolves trade-offs.

Even with recently proposed Agile\nModeling techniques, which enable rapid bootstrapping of image classifiers,\nusers are still required to spend 30 minutes or more of monotonous, repetitive\ndata labeling just to train a single classifier. Drawing on Fiske's Cognitive\nMiser theory, we propose a new framework that alleviates manual effort by\nreplacing human labeling with natural language interactions, reducing the total\neffort required to define a concept by an order of magnitude: from labeling\n2,000 images to only 100 plus some natural language interactions. Our framework\nleverages recent advances in foundation models, both large language models and\nvision-language models, to carve out the concept space through conversation and\nby automatically labeling training data points.

We are the first to identify the generating mechanism of\nsuch a phenomenon, and employ topological analysis to rigorously prove the\nexistence of policy bifurcation in safe RL, which corresponds to the\ncontractibility of the reachable tuple. Our theorem reveals that in scenarios\nwhere the obstacle-free state space is non-simply connected, a feasible policy\nis required to be bifurcated, meaning its output action needs to change\nabruptly in response to the varying state. To train such a bifurcated policy,\nwe propose a safe RL algorithm called multimodal policy optimization (MUPO),\nwhich utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution as the policy output. The\nbifurcated behavior can be achieved by selecting the Gaussian component with\nthe highest mixing coefficient. Besides, MUPO also integrates spectral\nnormalization and forward KL divergence to enhance the policy's capability of\nexploring different modes.

In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected\ndatasets, and others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the\nenvironments.

Many methodologies\nseek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the\npresentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these\nmethods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth\nand infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity\nmobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when\neither modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an\naccurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to\novercome the issues above. The primary innovation of this work lies in the\nfollowing aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and\nauditory modalities using three commonly available sensors: camera, speaker,\nand microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three\nhierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion;\n(3). We propose a multi-head training strategy, allowing the model to output\npredictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, resulting in a more\nflexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness,\nand flexibility of M3FAS under various challenging experimental settings.

However, most models often\nsuffer from unsatisfactory multimodal cooperation, which cannot jointly utilize\nall modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the\nworse learnt modality, but they are often hard to provide the fine-grained\nobservation of multimodal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support.\nHence, it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained\ncooperation between modalities, especially when facing realistic scenarios\nwhere the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this\nend, we introduce a sample-level modality valuation metric to evaluate the\ncontribution of each modality for each sample.

These degradations typically\narise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient\nconditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous\nspecialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific\ntype of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant\nattention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model\nwithout requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,\nthese methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the\ndistinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To\naddress this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network\nbased on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that different degradation types impact the image content on\ndifferent frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each\nrestoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency\ninformation from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra\nof the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a\nbidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency\ncomponents. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input\nfor a progressively guided restoration.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in DPM\nand, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a\nnovel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model.

Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy,\ntheir size can be effectively reduced by \"tensorization\" while maintaining\naccuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with\ncompact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or\nquantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly\ntraining the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards\nlow-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We\nfound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be\ntruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but\nnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation\ncompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how\ninformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated\nmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs\nof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of\nconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum.

This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more\neffective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and\nTask-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\\nabla \\tau$), an optimization framework\ndesigned to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently.

Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which\nallows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image\ngeneration and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream\ntask, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to\nextract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges\nstyle information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the\ngeneration of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging\nstyles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work,\nwe use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of\nour method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further\ndemonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge\nabout tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic\nimages with known layouts. This allows us to generate additional synthetic data\nto train a segmentation network in a semi-supervised fashion. We verify the\nadded value of the generated images by showing improved segmentation results\nand lower performance variability between patients when synthetic images are\nincluded during segmentation training.

Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We\nfound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be\ntruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but\nnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation\ncompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how\ninformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated\nmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs\nof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of\nconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our\nresults can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.\n","authors":["Sukhbinder Singh","Saeed S.

This objective aims to preserve the\nrepresentations of certain selected vectors while memorizing the\nrepresentations of new factual information. Specifically, ROME optimizes this\nobjective using an equality constraint, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible\nleast-square constraint. In addition to making batched edits, MEMIT also edits\nthe model at multiple layers.

This problem is motivated by several real-world\napplications (e.g., cellular network configuration, dynamic pricing, and policy\nselection) where an action taken by a central entity influences a large\npopulation that contributes to the global reward. However, collecting such\nreward feedback from the entire population not only incurs a prohibitively high\ncost but often leads to privacy concerns. To tackle this problem, we consider\ndifferentially private distributed linear bandits, where only a subset of users\nfrom the population are selected (called clients) to participate in the\nlearning process and the central server learns the global model from such\npartial feedback by iteratively aggregating these clients' local feedback in a\ndifferentially private fashion. We then propose a unified algorithmic learning\nframework, called differentially private distributed phased elimination\n(DP-DPE), which can be naturally integrated with popular differential privacy\n(DP) models (including central DP, local DP, and shuffle DP). Furthermore, we\nprove that DP-DPE achieves both sublinear regret and sublinear communication\ncost.

Since transportation system inherently\npossesses graph structures, many research efforts have been put with graph\nneural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown\npromising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure.\nHowever, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases and do\nnot reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be\nproblematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often\nsuffer from unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive\nGraph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by\nprogressively adapting to online input data during the training and testing\nphases.

Then, the\nmodel is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit\nto extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs\nthe traffic prediction. When applied to seven real-world traffic datasets of\ndiverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with consistency in all datasets.

To tackle this issue, we propose\ncontent-motion latent diffusion model (CMD), a novel efficient extension of\npretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, we\npropose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of a\ncontent frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latent\nrepresentation. The former represents the common content, and the latter\nrepresents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate the\ncontent frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and we\ngenerate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweight\ndiffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent space\nthat can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has not\nbeen done in previous latent video diffusion models.

In\nthis paper, we introduce LANDER (Label Text Centered Data-Free Knowledge\nTransfer) to address this issue by utilizing label text embeddings (LTE)\nproduced by pretrained language models. Specifically, during the model training\nphase, our approach treats LTE as anchor points and constrains the feature\nembeddings of corresponding training samples around them, enriching the\nsurrounding area with more meaningful information. In the DFKT phase, by using\nthese LTE anchors, LANDER can synthesize more meaningful samples, thereby\neffectively addressing the forgetting problem. Additionally, instead of tightly\nconstraining embeddings toward the anchor, the Bounding Loss is introduced to\nencourage sample embeddings to remain flexible within a defined radius.

In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images\nwithout hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch\nfiltering.

We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach to\nreproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. We\nadopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the\nperiodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free\nfake images, and we name our method DeepNotch.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution\npixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to\nhierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on\nlow-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural\nchoices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions\nsignificantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and\nslow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for\nefficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The\nkey principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during\ntraining, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local\ninteractions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between\ntokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the\nhigh-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this\nstrategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary\nembeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and\nit is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We\napply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data.\nFirst, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with\n2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win.

In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of\nVLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We\nfind that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated\nby maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose\nverbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to\ninduce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference.

In applications such\nas autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are\nusually passed through a \"virtual sensor\" realized by a deep learning model, to\nproduce \"measurements\" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a\ntracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are\naccumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We\nargue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information,\nand therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal\ninformation, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the\nend of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called\nMULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object,\na pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the\ninput buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly\nused lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the\nresulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not\nonly to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct\nmore sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by\nthe pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death\nmodels.

However, its direct adaption in medical image\nsegmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy\nand unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points\nto obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI\nscans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although\nquite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the\nefficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods\nonly capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors. In this work, we propose a\ncomprehensive and scalable 3D SAM model for whole-body CT segmentation, named\nCT-SAM3D. Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation\nmodel using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,\nensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts\nis crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory\nconstraints. For this purpose, we propose two key technical developments: 1) a\nprogressively and spatially aligned prompt encoding method to effectively\nencode click prompts in local 3D space; and 2) a cross-patch prompt learning\nscheme to capture more 3D spatial context, which is beneficial for reducing the\nediting workloads when interactively prompting on large organs.

Furthermore,\nmany practical real-world situations involve a moving camera that continuously\nobserves its surroundings, and the temporal information of the input video\nstreams is simply overlooked by single-view methods. We propose a novel\nsolution that makes use of RGB video streams. Our framework consists of three\nmodules: a scale-aware monocular dense SLAM solution, a lightweight object pose\npredictor, and an object-level pose graph optimizer. The SLAM module utilizes a\nvideo stream and additional scale-sensitive readings to estimate camera poses\nand metric depth. The object pose predictor then generates canonical object\nrepresentations from RGB images. The object pose is estimated through geometric\nregistration of these canonical object representations with estimated object\ndepth points. All per-view estimates finally undergo optimization within a pose\ngraph, culminating in the output of robust and accurate canonical object poses.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that when utilizing public dataset\nsequences with high-quality depth information, the proposed method exhibits\ncomparable performance to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods.

When it contains only specific types of images, the classifier begins\nto rely on shortcuts - simplistic and erroneous rules for decision-making. This\nleads to high performance on the training dataset but inferior results on new,\nvaried images, as the classifier's generalization capability is reduced. For\nexample, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the\nmodel may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the\npresence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the\nmodel's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using\nbounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations\nrequires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel\npatch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to\ncapture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for\nmitigating bias. Our method consists of two steps. First, we extract the\napproximate location of a target using a pre-trained saliency detection model\nsupplemented by human verification for accuracy.

MSN predicts CADe polyp detector performance on in-domain Israel\nand out-of-domain Japan colonoscopies (r=0.79, 0.37 respectively). With few\nexamples of Japan detector performance to train on, MSN prediction of Japan\nperformance improves (r=0.56).\n  $\\textbf{Conclusion}$: Our technique can identify distribution shifts in\nclinical data and can predict CADe detector performance on unseen data, without\nlabels. Our self-supervised approach can aid in detecting when data in practice\nis different from training, such as between hospitals or data has meaningfully\nshifted from training.

A SLAM system often consists of a front-end\ncomponent for motion estimation and a back-end system for eliminating\nestimation drifts. Recent advancements suggest that data-driven methods are\nhighly effective for front-end tasks, while geometry-based methods continue to\nbe essential in the back-end processes. However, such a decoupled paradigm\nbetween the data-driven front-end and geometry-based back-end can lead to\nsub-optimal performance, consequently reducing the system's capabilities and\ngeneralization potential. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel\nself-supervised imperative learning framework, named imperative SLAM (iSLAM),\nwhich fosters reciprocal correction between the front-end and back-end, thus\nenhancing performance without necessitating any external supervision.\nSpecifically, we formulate the SLAM problem as a bilevel optimization so that\nthe front-end and back-end are bidirectionally connected. As a result, the\nfront-end model can learn global geometric knowledge obtained through pose\ngraph optimization by back-propagating the residuals from the back-end\ncomponent. We showcase the effectiveness of this new framework through an\napplication of stereo-inertial SLAM. The experiments show that the iSLAM\ntraining strategy achieves an accuracy improvement of 22% on average over a\nbaseline model. To the best of our knowledge, iSLAM is the first SLAM system\nshowing that the front-end and back-end components can mutually correct each\nother in a self-supervised manner.\n","authors":["Taimeng Fu","Shaoshu Su","Yiren Lu","Chen Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07894v5.pdf","comment":"The paper has been accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters\n  (RA-L)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14910v1","updated":"2024-03-22T02:06:44Z","published":"2024-03-22T02:06:44Z","title":"Defying Imbalanced Forgetting in Class Incremental Learning","summary":"  We observe a high level of imbalance in the accuracy of different classes in\nthe same old task for the first time. This intriguing phenomenon, discovered in\nreplay-based Class Incremental Learning (CIL), highlights the imbalanced\nforgetting of learned classes, as their accuracy is similar before the\noccurrence of catastrophic forgetting. This discovery remains previously\nunidentified due to the reliance on average incremental accuracy as the\nmeasurement for CIL, which assumes that the accuracy of classes within the same\ntask is similar. However, this assumption is invalid in the face of\ncatastrophic forgetting. Further empirical studies indicate that this\nimbalanced forgetting is caused by conflicts in representation between\nsemantically similar old and new classes. These conflicts are rooted in the\ndata imbalance present in replay-based CIL methods. Building on these insights,\nwe propose CLass-Aware Disentanglement (CLAD) to predict the old classes that\nare more likely to be forgotten and enhance their accuracy.

Nonetheless, existing approaches\nencounter a significant challenge when attempting to generate samples from\nrandom noise inputs, which inherently lack meaningful information.\nConsequently, these models struggle to effectively map this noise to the\nground-truth sample distribution, resulting in prolonging training times and\nlow-quality outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel Noisy Layer Generation\nmethod (NAYER) which relocates the random source from the input to a noisy\nlayer and utilizes the meaningful constant label-text embedding (LTE) as the\ninput. LTE is generated by using the language model once, and then it is stored\nin memory for all subsequent training processes. The significance of LTE lies\nin its ability to contain substantial meaningful inter-class information,\nenabling the generation of high-quality samples with only a few training steps.\nSimultaneously, the noisy layer plays a key role in addressing the issue of\ndiversity in sample generation by preventing the model from overemphasizing the\nconstrained label information. By reinitializing the noisy layer in each\niteration, we aim to facilitate the generation of diverse samples while still\nretaining the method's efficiency, thanks to the ease of learning provided by\nLTE.

In pursuit\nof this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1)\nstep recognition and (2) intra-video retrieval over a dataset of temporally\nsegmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk\nrecordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to make use of:\n(1) out-of-domain visual information; (2) a high temporal context window; and\n(3) multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) domains.

One of the\nchallenges is the lack of a simulation environment that will represent the\nactual plant as accurately as possible to train DRL policies. Stochasticity and\nnon-linearity of wastewater treatment data lead to unstable and incorrect\npredictions of models over long time horizons. One possible reason for the\nmodels' incorrect simulation behavior can be related to the issue of\ncompounding error, which is the accumulation of errors throughout the\nsimulation. The compounding error occurs because the model utilizes its\npredictions as inputs at each time step. The error between the actual data and\nthe prediction accumulates as the simulation continues. We implemented two\nmethods to improve the trained models for wastewater treatment data, which\nresulted in more accurate simulators: 1- Using the model's prediction data as\ninput in the training step as a tool of correction, and 2- Change in the loss\nfunction to consider the long-term predicted shape (dynamics).

The query optimizer relies on precise\nselectivity and cost estimates to effectively optimize queries prior to\nexecution. While this strategy is effective for relational DBMSs, it is not\nsufficient for DBMSs tailored for processing machine learning (ML) queries. In\nML-centric DBMSs, query optimization is challenging for two reasons. First, the\nperformance bottleneck of the queries shifts to user-defined functions (UDFs)\nthat often wrap around deep learning models, making it difficult to accurately\nestimate UDF statistics without profiling the query. This leads to inaccurate\nstatistics and sub-optimal query plans. Second, the optimal query plan for ML\nqueries is data-dependent, necessitating DBMSs to adapt the query plan on the\nfly during execution. So, a static query plan is not sufficient for such\nqueries.\n  In this paper, we present Hydro, an ML-centric DBMS that utilizes adaptive\nquery processing (AQP) for efficiently processing ML queries. Hydro is designed\nto quickly evaluate UDF-based query predicates by ensuring optimal predicate\nevaluation order and improving the scalability of UDF execution. By integrating\nAQP, Hydro continuously monitors UDF statistics, routes data to predicates in\nan optimal order, and dynamically allocates resources for evaluating\npredicates.

Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial when\nshaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e., image-to-video\ngeneration). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion\nprocess of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful\nalignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among\nadjacent frames. To alleviate this, we present TRIP, a new recipe of\nimage-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from\nstatic image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the\ncoherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically, the\nimage noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process\nbased on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next, TRIP executes a\nresidual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that\ndirectly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to\namplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a\nresidual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent\ncodes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning, thereby easing the learning\nof the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore, both reference and residual\nnoise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final\nvideo generation.

To address this, we introduce a Self-Adaptive Guidance (SAG) mechanism.\nIt dynamically computes a reality score, enhancing the sharpness of the\nrealistic latent. These alternating mechanisms collectively achieve\nartifact-free super-resolution.

Testing 25 CLIP variants in a\nzero-shot classification task, we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage\npoints lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled\nimages.

The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target\ntasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks\nhave been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three\ndimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic\nones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of\nthe imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can\npretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work,\nwe propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data\nbased on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn\nthe relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as\nregressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging\nplanes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack. Both pretext\ntasks are conceptually straightforward and easy to implement, and can be\ncombined in multitask learning for better representation learning.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made\nconsiderable achievements in MIS. However, they are difficult to fully collect\nglobal context information and their pooling layer may cause information loss.\nCapsule networks, which combine the benefits of CNNs while taking into account\nadditional information such as relative location that CNNs do not, have lately\ndemonstrated some advantages in MIS.

Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion\n(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new\ninformative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based\non natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant\nGPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method\ntailored specifically for ultrasound applications.

Uni-RLHF contains three packages: 1) a universal multi-feedback\nannotation platform, 2) large-scale crowdsourced feedback datasets, and 3)\nmodular offline RLHF baseline implementations. Uni-RLHF develops a\nuser-friendly annotation interface tailored to various feedback types,\ncompatible with a wide range of mainstream RL environments.

However, GAN-based denoising\nalgorithms still suffer from limitations in capturing complex relationships\nwithin the images. In this regard, the loss function plays a crucial role in\nguiding the image generation process, encompassing how much a synthetic image\ndiffers from a real image. To grasp highly complex and non-linear textural\nrelationships in the training process, this work presents a loss function that\nleverages the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the Gray-Level-Co-occurrence\nMatrix (GLCM). Although the recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated\nsuperior performance in classification and detection tasks, we hypothesize that\nits information content can be valuable when integrated into GANs' training. To\nthis end, we propose a differentiable implementation of the GLCM suited for\ngradient-based optimization.

Fortunately,\nin this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is\nidentifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to\n$Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed\npath to $Y$ without passing $X$. Specifically, we propose a Poisson Branching\nStructure Causal Model (PB-SCM) and perform a path analysis on PB-SCM using\nhigh-order cumulants. Theoretical results establish the connection between the\npath and cumulant and demonstrate that the path information can be obtained\nfrom the cumulant. With the path information, causal order is identifiable\nunder some graphical conditions. A practical algorithm for learning causal\nstructure under PB-SCM is proposed and the experiments demonstrate and verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","authors":["Jie Qiao","Yu Xiang","Zhengming Chen","Ruichu Cai","Zhifeng Hao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16523v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by AAAI-2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08929v2","updated":"2024-03-25T08:00:38Z","published":"2023-06-15T08:02:07Z","title":"On the resilience of Collaborative Learning-based Recommender Systems\n  Against Community Detection Attack","summary":"  Collaborative-learning-based recommender systems emerged following the\nsuccess of collaborative learning techniques such as Federated Learning (FL)\nand Gossip Learning (GL).

However, due to\nstructural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic\nflow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and\nperiodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the\nkey temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a\ncompact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN\n(Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively\nconsidering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow.\nFirst, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked\nsubseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context\nin a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and\ncontextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series.\nThen, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by\nusing stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are\nextracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making\ntime-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn\nfine-grained short-term temporal features.

Detection of errors is the first step to mitigating their\nimpact on a system and thus, efficient error detection for LLMs is an important\nissue. In many settings, the LLM is considered as a black box with no access to\nthe internal nodes; this prevents the use of many error detection schemes that\nneed access to the model's internal nodes. An interesting observation is that\nthe output of LLMs in error-free operation should be valid and normal text.\nTherefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from normal\ntext, it is likely that there is an error. Based on this observation we propose\nto perform Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED); this scheme extracts\nsome linguistic features of the text generated by the LLM and feeds them to a\nconcurrent classifier that detects errors. Since the proposed error detection\nmechanism only relies on the outputs of the model, then it can be used on LLMs\nin which there is no access to the internal nodes. The proposed CLED scheme has\nbeen evaluated on the T5 model when used for news summarization and on the\nOPUS-MT model when used for translation. In both cases, the same set of\nlinguistic features has been used for error detection to illustrate the\napplicability of the proposed scheme beyond a specific case. The results show\nthat CLED can detect most of the errors at a low overhead penalty. The use of\nthe concurrent classifier also enables a trade-off between error detection\neffectiveness and its associated overhead, so providing flexibility to a\ndesigner.\n","authors":["Jinhua Zhu","Javier Conde","Zhen Gao","Pedro Reviriego","Shanshan Liu","Fabrizio Lombardi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16393v1.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 6 figures, 30 references"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16391v1","updated":"2024-03-25T03:13:56Z","published":"2024-03-25T03:13:56Z","title":"Physics-informed RL for Maximal Safety Probability Estimation","summary":"  Accurate risk quantification and reachability analysis are crucial for safe\ncontrol and learning, but sampling from rare events, risky states, or long-term\ntrajectories can be prohibitively costly. Motivated by this, we study how to\nestimate the long-term safety probability of maximally safe actions without\nsufficient coverage of samples from risky states and long-term trajectories.\nThe use of maximal safety probability in control and learning is expected to\navoid conservative behaviors due to over-approximation of risk. Here, we first\nshow that long-term safety probability, which is multiplicative in time, can be\nconverted into additive costs and be solved using standard reinforcement\nlearning methods. We then derive this probability as solutions of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) and propose Physics-Informed Reinforcement\nLearning (PIRL) algorithm. The proposed method can learn using sparse rewards\nbecause the physics constraints help propagate risk information through\nneighbors. This suggests that, for the purpose of extracting more information\nfor efficient learning, physics constraints can serve as an alternative to\nreward shaping.

Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion\n(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new\ninformative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based\non natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant\nGPU resources due to their heavy parameters.

Specifically, instead of assuming every compared item has a fixed\nlatent score $\\{\\theta_i^*\\}_{i=1}^n$, we assume the underlying scores are\ngiven by $\\{\\alpha_i^*+{x}_i^\\top\\beta^*\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\\alpha_i^*$ and\n${x}_i^\\top\\beta^*$ represent latent baseline and covariate score of the $i$-th\nitem, respectively. We impose natural identifiability conditions and derive the\n$\\ell_{\\infty}$- and $\\ell_2$-optimal rates for the maximum likelihood\nestimator of $\\{\\alpha_i^*\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and $\\beta^*$ under a sparse comparison\ngraph, using a novel `leave-one-out' technique (Chen et al., 2019) . To conduct\nstatistical inferences, we further derive asymptotic distributions for the MLE\nof $\\{\\alpha_i^*\\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\\beta^*$ with minimal sample complexity. This\nallows us to answer the question whether some covariates have any explanation\npower for latent scores and to threshold some sparse parameters to improve the\nranking performance. We improve the approximation method used in (Gao et al.,\n2021) for the BLT model and generalize it to the CARE model.

The recurrent\nneural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves\nattractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This\nstudy applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows\nunder surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet\ndynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid\nsurfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using\nonly dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical\nsimulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell\nfront-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference\nstrategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent\nneural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from\ngeometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study\nshows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for\ninstance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of\nReynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase\nsequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available\nin experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them\nto estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While\nour methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its\nadaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future\nexploration.

Second, the field of lyric translation suffers from a\nlack of publicly available datasets; to the best of our knowledge, no such\ndataset exists. To broaden the scope of genres and languages in lyric\ntranslation studies, we introduce a novel singable lyric translation dataset,\napproximately 89\\% of which consists of K-pop song lyrics. This dataset aligns\nKorean and English lyrics line-by-line and section-by-section.

From calculating biomarkers such as ejection\nfraction to the probability of a patient's heart failure, accurate segmentation\nof the heart structures allows doctors to assess the heart's condition and\ndevise treatments with greater precision and accuracy. However, achieving\naccurate and reliable left ventricle segmentation is time-consuming and\nchallenging due to different reasons. Hence, clinicians often rely on\nsegmenting the left ventricular (LV) in two specific echocardiogram frames to\nmake a diagnosis. This limited coverage in manual LV segmentation poses a\nchallenge for developing automatic LV segmentation with high temporal\nconsistency, as the resulting dataset is typically annotated sparsely. In\nresponse to this challenge, this work introduces SimLVSeg, a novel paradigm\nthat enables video-based networks for consistent LV segmentation from sparsely\nannotated echocardiogram videos. SimLVSeg consists of self-supervised\npre-training with temporal masking, followed by weakly supervised learning\ntailored for LV segmentation from sparse annotations. We demonstrate how\nSimLVSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by achieving a 93.32%\n(95%CI 93.21-93.43%) dice score on the largest 2D+time echocardiography dataset\n(EchoNet-Dynamic) while being more efficient. SimLVSeg is compatible with two\ntypes of video segmentation networks: 2D super image and 3D segmentation. To\nshow the effectiveness of our approach, we provide extensive ablation studies,\nincluding pre-training settings and various deep learning backbones. We further\nconduct an out-of-distribution test to showcase SimLVSeg's generalizability on\nunseen distribution (CAMUS dataset).

Firstly, we leverage an ensemble of publicly\navailable 3D datasets to facilitate the training of large-scale models.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also\ninsufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,\ntherefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being\nassigned no relation as a GT. To address these issues, we propose Groupwise\nQuery Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise\nQuery Specialization trains a specialized query by dividing queries and\nrelations into disjoint groups and directing a query in a specific query group\nsolely toward relations in the corresponding relation group.

To mitigate the problem of the absence of a\nparallel AV2AV translation dataset, we propose to train our spoken language\ntranslation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A.

The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping.

SeFFeC consists of a transformer-based encoder network that\ntakes a latent vector of a pre-trained generative model and a facial feature\nembedding as input, and learns to modify the latent vector to perform the\ndesired face edit operation. To ensure that the desired feature measurement is\nchanged towards the target value without altering uncorrelated features, we\nintroduced a novel semantic face feature loss. Qualitative and quantitative\nresults show that SeFFeC enables precise and fine-grained control of 23 facial\nfeatures, some of which could not previously be controlled by other methods,\nwithout requiring manual annotations. Unlike existing methods, SeFFeC also\nprovides deterministic control over the exact values of the facial features and\nmore localised and disentangled face edits.\n","authors":["Florian Strohm","Mihai Bâce","Markus Kaltenecker","Andreas Bulling"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13972v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17477v1","updated":"2024-03-26T08:13:02Z","published":"2024-03-26T08:13:02Z","title":"DiffGaze: A Diffusion Model for Continuous Gaze Sequence Generation on\n  360° Images","summary":"  We present DiffGaze, a novel method for generating realistic and diverse\ncontinuous human gaze sequences on 360{\\deg} images based on a conditional\nscore-based denoising diffusion model.

Given an image, FEC\nalternates between grouping pixels into individual clusters to abstract\nrepresentatives and updating the deep features of pixels with current\nrepresentatives. Such an iterative working mechanism is implemented in the form\nof several neural layers and the final representatives can be used for\ndownstream tasks. The cluster assignments across layers, which can be viewed\nand inspected by humans, make the forward process of FEC fully transparent and\nempower it with promising ad-hoc interpretability. Extensive experiments on\nvarious visual recognition models and tasks verify the effectiveness,\ngenerality, and interpretability of FEC. We expect this work will provoke a\nrethink of the current de facto grid-style paradigm.\n","authors":["Guikun Chen","Xia Li","Yi Yang","Wenguan Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17409v1.pdf","comment":"CVPR 2024.

This study seeks to reduce the computational\nresources needed to determine a battery's internal states by replacing\nphysics-based Li-ion battery models -- such as the single-particle model (SPM)\nand the pseudo-2D (P2D) model -- with a physics-informed neural network (PINN)\nsurrogate. The surrogate model makes high-throughput techniques, such as\nBayesian calibration, tractable to determine battery internal parameters from\nvoltage responses. This manuscript is the first of a two-part series that\nintroduces PINN surrogates of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference\n(i.e., state-of-health diagnostics). In this first part, a method is presented\nfor constructing a PINN surrogate of the SPM. A multi-fidelity hierarchical\ntraining, where several neural nets are trained with multiple physics-loss\nfidelities is shown to significantly improve the surrogate accuracy when only\ntraining on the governing equation residuals. The implementation is made\navailable in a companion repository (https://github.com/NREL/pinnstripes). The\ntechniques used to develop a PINN surrogate of the SPM are extended in Part II\nfor the PINN surrogate for the P2D battery model, and explore the Bayesian\ncalibration capabilities of both surrogates.\n","authors":["Malik Hassanaly","Peter J.

Furthermore, generalization to unseen objects is\nhindered by the limited scale of available hand-object interaction datasets. We\npropose DiffH2O, a novel method to synthesize realistic, one or two-handed\nobject interactions from provided text prompts and geometry of the object. The\nmethod introduces three techniques that enable effective learning from limited\ndata. First, we decompose the task into a grasping stage and a text-based\ninteraction stage and use separate diffusion models for each. In the grasping\nstage, the model only generates hand motions, whereas in the interaction phase\nboth hand and object poses are synthesized. Second, we propose a compact\nrepresentation that tightly couples hand and object poses. Third, we propose\ntwo different guidance schemes to allow more control of the generated motions:\ngrasp guidance and detailed textual guidance. Grasp guidance takes a single\ntarget grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach this grasp at the\nend of the grasping stage, which provides control over the grasping pose. Given\na grasping motion from this stage, multiple different actions can be prompted\nin the interaction phase. For textual guidance, we contribute comprehensive\ntext descriptions to the GRAB dataset and show that they enable our method to\nhave more fine-grained control over hand-object interactions.

The core of transformer architecture lies\nin the self-attention mechanism, which computes the pairwise attention scores\nin a sequence.

In this\nsetting, the pairwise attention scores can be derived by both semantic\ndifference and positional difference. However, prior studies often model the\ntwo kinds of difference measurements in different ways, which potentially\nlimits the expressive capacity of sequence modeling. To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a novel transformer variant with complex vector attention,\nnamed EulerFormer, which provides a unified theoretical framework to formulate\nboth semantic difference and positional difference. The EulerFormer involves\ntwo key technical improvements. First, it employs a new transformation function\nfor efficiently transforming the sequence tokens into polar-form complex\nvectors using Euler's formula, enabling the unified modeling of both semantic\nand positional information in a complex rotation form.Secondly, it develops a\ndifferential rotation mechanism, where the semantic rotation angles can be\ncontrolled by an adaptation function, enabling the adaptive integration of the\nsemantic and positional information according to the semantic\ncontexts.Furthermore, a phase contrastive learning task is proposed to improve\nthe anisotropy of contextual representations in EulerFormer.

These approaches do not\ninvestigate or employ multiple kernel functions to address the extrapolation\nchallenge. Drawing on the ALiBi approach, this study proposes a novel relative\npositional encoding method, called MEP, which employs a weighted average to\ncombine distinct kernel functions(such as the exponential kernel and the\nGaussian kernel) to generate a bias that is applied to post-softmax attention\nscores.

However, this assumption\ncan be easily violated in real-world applications, leading to the\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problem. Understanding how modern over-parameterized\nDNNs behave under non-trivial natural distributional shifts is essential, as\ncurrent theoretical understanding is insufficient. Existing theoretical works\noften provide meaningless results for over-parameterized models in OOD\nscenarios or even contradict empirical findings. To this end, we are\ninvestigating the performance of the over-parameterized model in terms of OOD\ngeneralization under the general benign overfitting conditions. Our analysis\nfocuses on a random feature model and examines non-trivial natural\ndistributional shifts, where the benign overfitting estimators demonstrate a\nconstant excess OOD loss, despite achieving zero excess in-distribution (ID)\nloss. We demonstrate that in this scenario, further increasing the model's\nparameterization can significantly reduce the OOD loss. Intuitively, the\nvariance term of ID loss remains low due to orthogonality of long-tail\nfeatures, meaning overfitting noise during training generally doesn't raise\ntesting loss. However, in OOD cases, distributional shift increases the\nvariance term. Thankfully, the inherent shift is unrelated to individual x,\nmaintaining the orthogonality of long-tail features.

This lack of interpretability can be a\nreal drawback for acceptance of RF models in several real-world applications,\nespecially those affecting one's lives, such as in healthcare, security, and\nlaw. In this work, we present Forest-ORE, a method that makes RF interpretable\nvia an optimized rule ensemble (ORE) for local and global interpretation.\nUnlike other rule-based approaches aiming at interpreting the RF model, this\nmethod simultaneously considers several parameters that influence the choice of\nan interpretable rule ensemble. Existing methods often prioritize predictive\nperformance over interpretability coverage and do not provide information about\nexisting overlaps or interactions between rules. Forest-ORE uses a\nmixed-integer optimization program to build an ORE that considers the trade-off\nbetween predictive performance, interpretability coverage, and model size (size\nof the rule ensemble, rule lengths, and rule overlaps). In addition to\nproviding an ORE competitive in predictive performance with RF, this method\nenriches the ORE through other rules that afford complementary information. It\nalso enables monitoring of the rule selection process and delivers various\nmetrics that can be used to generate a graphical representation of the final\nmodel.

Most existing\napproaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two\nof these paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a versatile adaptation approach\nthat can effectively work under all three settings. Specifically, we propose\nthe dual memory networks that comprise dynamic and static memory components.\nThe static memory caches training data knowledge, enabling training-free\nfew-shot adaptation, while the dynamic memory preserves historical test\nfeatures online during the testing process, allowing for the exploration of\nadditional data insights beyond the training set. This novel capability\nenhances model performance in the few-shot setting and enables model usability\nin the absence of training data. The two memory networks employ the same\nflexible memory interactive strategy, which can operate in a training-free mode\nand can be further enhanced by incorporating learnable projection layers.

In this paper, to solve the exemplar-free\nCIL problem, we propose a Dual-Stream Analytic Learning (DS-AL) approach. The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping.

In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For\ninstance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on\nthe route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the\nfuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation\nlearning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model\nbut are also dependent on a cost-constrained model.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district. The DGT technique is applied to\nfine-tune several transformer-based models, on this new dataset. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5. This\nis attributed to ByT5's ability to handle a high percentage of\nout-of-vocabulary words in the test set.

While private computing\nenvironments (e.g., secure enclaves), and cryptographic approaches (e.g.,\nhomomorphic encryption) provide strong privacy protection, their computing\nperformance still falls short compared to cloud GPUs. To achieve privacy\nprotection with high computing performance, we propose Delta, a new private\ntraining and inference framework, with comparable model performance as\nnon-private centralized training. Delta features two asymmetric data flows: the\nmain information-sensitive flow and the residual flow. The main part flows into\na small model while the residuals are offloaded to a large model. Specifically,\nDelta embeds the information-sensitive representations into a low-dimensional\nspace while pushing the information-insensitive part into high-dimension\nresiduals. To ensure privacy protection, the low-dimensional\ninformation-sensitive part is secured and fed to a small model in a private\nenvironment. On the other hand, the residual part is sent to fast cloud GPUs,\nand processed by a large model. To further enhance privacy and reduce the\ncommunication cost, Delta applies a random binary quantization technique along\nwith a DP-based technique to the residuals before sharing them with the public\nplatform. We theoretically show that Delta guarantees differential privacy in\nthe public environment and greatly reduces the complexity in the private\nenvironment.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Most\nmethods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under\nvariations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions)\nin the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images\noften have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as\nthe image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nMotivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in\nstructure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast\ninvariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation.

This results in\ntwo filtered images preserving topologically critical structure. Applying the\nproposed DSAIF to mutually supervised networks decreases the consensus of their\nerroneous predictions on unlabeled images.

This approach, coupled with\nstrategic cross-LoRA feature and attention injection, guides the style transfer\nprocess. The foundation of our methodology is rooted in the observation that\nLoRA maintains the spatial feature consistency of UNet, a discovery that\nfurther inspired the development of a mask-wise style transfer technique. This\ntechnique employs masks extracted through a pre-trained FastSAM model,\nutilizing mask prompts to facilitate feature fusion during the denoising\nprocess, thereby enabling localized style transfer that preserves the original\nimage's unaffected regions. Moreover, our approach accommodates multiple style\ntargets through the use of corresponding masks. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we demonstrate that DiffStyler surpasses previous methods in\nachieving a more harmonious balance between content preservation and style\nintegration.\n","authors":["Shaoxu Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18461v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10522v4","updated":"2024-03-27T11:18:51Z","published":"2023-11-17T13:43:43Z","title":"Enhancing Object Coherence in Layout-to-Image Synthesis","summary":"  Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image\ngeneration. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine\ncontrol over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains\nchallenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence\n(e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the\nhand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a\nnovel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and\nself-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for\nthis task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains\nrich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in\nthe images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and\ngenerated images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and\nsemantic coherence separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in\nour experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout\nrestriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the\nimage synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we\ndevelop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly\nintegrate local contextual physical coherence into each pixel's generation\nprocess. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the coherence\nrestrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding.\nThrough visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of\nSCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable\nphysical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in\nboth image generation quality and controllability.\n","authors":["Yibin Wang","Weizhong Zhang","Jianwei Zheng","Cheng Jin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10522v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18454v1","updated":"2024-03-27T11:13:20Z","published":"2024-03-27T11:13:20Z","title":"Scaling Vision-and-Language Navigation With Offline RL","summary":"  The study of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has typically relied on\nexpert trajectories, which may not always be available in real-world situations\ndue to the significant effort required to collect them.

Initially, we transform a video into a\nsingle composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The\nresulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while\nmaintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal\ninformation within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach\nenables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without\nnecessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis\nacross ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five\nopen-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image\nGrid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out\nof ten benchmarks.\n","authors":["Wonkyun Kim","Changin Choi","Wonseok Lee","Wonjong Rhee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18406v1.pdf","comment":"Our code is available at https://github.com/imagegridworth/IG-VLM"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05262v2","updated":"2024-03-27T09:43:41Z","published":"2024-03-08T12:35:07Z","title":"Debiasing Multimodal Large Language Models","summary":"  In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in\ngenerating textual descriptions based on visual inputs. Despite their\nadvancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated\ncontent, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly,\nfor tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we\npropose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the\noutput distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores\nfor each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective\nregularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more\nintricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias\nsampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods.\nFurthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across\nvarious decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different\nsettings, we significantly enhance performance, surpassing reported results and\nraising concerns about the fairness of existing evaluations.

They align the\ndistribution differences between domains as encoders without considering their\nunique characteristics. For instance, ViT excels in accuracy due to its\nsuperior ability to capture global representations, while CNN has an advantage\nin capturing local representations. This fact has led us to design a hybrid\nmethod to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN, called Explicitly\nClass-specific Boundaries (ECB). ECB learns CNN on ViT to combine their\ndistinct strengths. In particular, we leverage ViT's properties to explicitly\nfind class-specific decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancy between\nthe outputs of the two classifiers to detect target samples far from the source\nsupport. In contrast, the CNN encoder clusters target features based on the\npreviously defined class-specific boundaries by minimizing the discrepancy\nbetween the probabilities of the two classifiers. Finally, ViT and CNN mutually\nexchange knowledge to improve the quality of pseudo labels and reduce the\nknowledge discrepancies of these models.

While existing 3D hair modeling\nmethods have achieved impressive performance, the challenge of achieving\nhigh-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture\nconditions, making practical applications difficult, or heavily rely on learned\nprior data, obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MonoHair,a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity\nhair reconstruction from a monocular video, without specific requirements for\nenvironments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main\nstages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The\nexterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization\n(PMVO). This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from\nmultiple views, independent of prior data, to produce a high-fidelity exterior\n3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates\nthe inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior, we employ a\ndata-driven, multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D\nstructural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior, mirroring the\nsynthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges\nthe domain gap between our training data and real-world data, thereby enhancing\nthe accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly, we\ngenerate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair\ngrowth algorithm.

Recent studies have investigated various approaches to\noptimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint\nrepresentations.

The presented\nmethodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that\nare trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific\ntimes, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the\ndata is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all\nindividuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be\napplied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated\ndataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures. The results\nshow that if the data is homogeneously sampled the methodology works as\nintended and produces accurate survival models. The results also show that\nrandomly resampling the dataset on each epoch is an effective way to reduce the\nsize of the training data.\n","authors":["Olov Holmer","Mattias Krysander","Erik Frisk"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18739v1.pdf","comment":"7 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18735v1","updated":"2024-03-27T16:24:26Z","published":"2024-03-27T16:24:26Z","title":"Nonlinear model reduction for operator learning","summary":"  Operator learning provides methods to approximate mappings between\ninfinite-dimensional function spaces.

Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g.,\ncontent, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant\nchallenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into\nindividual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them\nindividually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with\nnovel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot\nway.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling.

The effects of such heterogeneity\nplay an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to\ndiscover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from\nexperimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this\nend, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)\napproach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic\nmaterials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with\nthe material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation\nfield, from loading field-displacement field measurements.

Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the\nkernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for\neach material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our\nHeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear\nand angular momentum guaranteed.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Here, we tackle the problem of graph generation from\nonly one observed graph. The classical approach of graph generation from\nparametric models relies on the estimation of parameters, which can be\ninconsistent or expensive to compute due to intractable normalisation\nconstants. Generative modelling based on machine learning techniques to\ngenerate high-quality graph samples avoids parameter estimation but usually\nrequires abundant training samples. Our proposed generating procedure,\nSteinGen, which is phrased in the setting of graphs as realisations of\nexponential random graph models, combines ideas from Stein's method and MCMC by\nemploying Markovian dynamics which are based on a Stein operator for the target\nmodel. SteinGen uses the Glauber dynamics associated with an estimated Stein\noperator to generate a sample, and re-estimates the Stein operator from the\nsample after every sampling step.

To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty.

Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant\nframes and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose\ntokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model\nefficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster\n(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic\ndiversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames.

In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory,\na diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the\nperformance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to\nunify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To\ndo this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion\npatterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive\nanchor working in the Singular space.

In\nthis work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer\narchitectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a\ncomparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based\nprostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label\nnoise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer\nclassification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier\nwith MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that\nfor both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones\nlag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more\nnoticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can\nimprove performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a\nspecificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for\nmodelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust\nfeatures than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the\nbest architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an\neffective way to improve performance.\n","authors":["Mohamed Harmanani","Paul F. R.

However, it seems that self-attention is not always\nnecessary, especially in sparse spike-form calculation manners. In this paper,\nwe innovatively replace vanilla SSA (using dynamic bases calculating from Query\nand Key) with spike-form Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, and their\ncombinations (using fixed triangular or wavelets bases), based on a key\nhypothesis that both of them use a set of basis functions for information\ntransformation. Hence, the Fourier-or-Wavelet-based spikformer (FWformer) is\nproposed and verified in visual classification tasks, including both static\nimage and event-based video datasets. The FWformer can achieve comparable or\neven higher accuracies ($0.4\\%$-$1.5\\%$), higher running speed ($9\\%$-$51\\%$\nfor training and $19\\%$-$70\\%$ for inference), reduced theoretical energy\nconsumption ($20\\%$-$25\\%$), and reduced GPU memory usage ($4\\%$-$26\\%$),\ncompared to the standard spikformer.

Techniques such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) have been introduced\nto allow IDSs analyze the content of network packets, providing more context\nfor identifying potential threats. IDSs traditionally rely on using\nanomaly-based and signature-based detection techniques to detect unrecognized\nand suspicious activity. Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in\nDPI for IDSs due to their efficiency in learning intricate patterns from the\npacket content being transmitted through the network. In this paper, we propose\na revolutionary DPI algorithm based on transformers adapted for the purpose of\ndetecting malicious traffic with a classifier head. Transformers learn the\ncomplex content of sequence data and generalize them well to similar scenarios\nthanks to their self-attention mechanism. Our proposed method uses the raw\npayload bytes that represent the packet contents and is deployed as\nman-in-the-middle. The payload bytes are used to detect malicious packets and\nclassify their types. Experimental results on the UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IOT23\ndatasets demonstrate that our transformer-based model is effective in\ndistinguishing malicious from benign traffic in the test dataset, attaining an\naverage accuracy of 79\\% using binary classification and 72\\% on the\nmulti-classification experiment, both using solely payload bytes.\n","authors":["Kyle Stein","Arash Mahyari","Guillermo Francia III","Eman El-Sheikh"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18223v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18222v1","updated":"2024-03-27T03:19:36Z","published":"2024-03-27T03:19:36Z","title":"Uncertainty-Aware Deployment of Pre-trained Language-Conditioned\n  Imitation Learning Policies","summary":"  Large-scale robotic policies trained on data from diverse tasks and robotic\nplatforms hold great promise for enabling general-purpose robots; however,\nreliable generalization to new environment conditions remains a major\nchallenge.

Existing embedding compression solutions cannot simultaneously meet\nthree key design requirements: memory efficiency, low latency, and adaptability\nto dynamic data distribution. This paper presents CAFE, a Compact, Adaptive,\nand Fast Embedding compression framework that addresses the above requirements.\nThe design philosophy of CAFE is to dynamically allocate more memory resources\nto important features (called hot features), and allocate less memory to\nunimportant ones. In CAFE, we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data\nstructure, named HotSketch, to capture feature importance and report hot\nfeatures in real time. For each reported hot feature, we assign it a unique\nembedding. For the non-hot features, we allow multiple features to share one\nembedding by using hash embedding technique. Guided by our design philosophy,\nwe further propose a multi-level hash embedding framework to optimize the\nembedding tables of non-hot features. We theoretically analyze the accuracy of\nHotSketch, and analyze the model convergence against deviation. Extensive\nexperiments show that CAFE significantly outperforms existing embedding\ncompression methods, yielding 3.92% and 3.68% superior testing AUC on Criteo\nKaggle dataset and CriteoTB dataset at a compression ratio of 10000x.

While extensive research aims to reduce\ndisparity, the effect of using a \\emph{finite dataset} -- as opposed to the\nentire population -- remains unclear. This paper explores the statistical\nfoundations of fair binary classification with two protected groups, focusing\non controlling demographic disparity, defined as the difference in acceptance\nrates between the groups. Although fairness may come at the cost of accuracy\neven with infinite data, we show that using a finite sample incurs additional\ncosts due to the need to estimate group-specific acceptance thresholds. We\nstudy the minimax optimal classification error while constraining demographic\ndisparity to a user-specified threshold. To quantify the impact of fairness\nconstraints, we introduce a novel measure called \\emph{fairness-aware excess\nrisk} and derive a minimax lower bound on this measure that all classifiers\nmust satisfy. Furthermore, we propose FairBayes-DDP+, a group-wise thresholding\nmethod with an offset that we show attains the minimax lower bound. Our lower\nbound proofs involve several innovations.
